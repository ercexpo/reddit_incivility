{"comment":"This post should be deleted. You can't just copy and past someone's writing just so you can get karma on Reddit. Want to read more stuff like you just pasted? Well, one thing you can do is stop copying and pasting and instead linking to the website, paywall or not. Reporters got to eat, too.\n\nEDIT: I'm getting down voted for this and I'm wearing it like a badge of honor. Further thoughts:\nIf you had any idea what it is like to work in a newsroom, and how much effort goes into creating good journalism, you would realize that people are using ad blockers (which, good for them, a lot of websites do it wrong. But some don't so whitelist). Those big investigative piece you read in the New York Times? Those are good, right? They lead to change and shed light on corruption or whatever. Well guess what? Someone or a few people likely spent a year on that story. One year. To write one story. Someone had to pay that reporter's salary, benefits, spend resources fact checking, etc. You want more of that? Support publications who put out good journalism. Don't just go copy and pasting.\nIn regards to Reddit and traffic. A) Publishers don't need you. When something makes it to the \"Front Page of Reddit\" it doesn't shower the publication in money. It gives a bump in traffic, and the reporter likely feels good as a result. B) There is a value exchange here, between you, the Reddit user and the publisher. You are being informed, entertained, etc because of content created by someone else.\nBut the people here want to copy and paste straight onto Reddit. Hell, why are we even linking then? Less bandwidth and whatnot, right? I'm sold that everyone that has down voted me is a selfish human or grossly misinformed.\nTotal disrespect to the writer of this piece.","label":0}

{"comment":"You need to somehow show people the maturity of the game.\n\nI don't mean explosions and gunfire - I mean strategical thought and foresight being critical to success. Gamers aren't idiots, and the clearest lesson the COD franchise has shown is that continuously catering to them makes for a terrible game. DICE should thank COD for increasing the multiplayer FPS market as those millions are ripe for the picking.\n\nBut if you are going to do it, it must be done will full awareness and display of the fact that this will be a deliberate, cerebral experience. BF3 is where wit defeats twitch, but not without excitement, and yes, bullets and explosions - and of course all those important battlefield moments that define the series. This game will balance the fun of firing with the considerations of reality.\n\nI say start with the chatter. Military-esque communication between players, if carefully thought out and delivered, (and preferably not just realistic, but almost instructive to would-be players), could in one fair swoop show that gaming has grown beyond team deathmatches and subtle, incremental improvements at full price, to teamwork, coordination, and even planning in order to succeed. This game is mature because gaming has matured.\n\nWar? With Battlefield 3, war is never the same.","label":0}

{"comment":"The Jedi really strayed from their original ideology. The Jedi of old studied all aspects of the force, and valued balance above all else.\n\nMany are of the opinion (myself included) that the Jedi Purge that was Order 66 was actually the will of the force. Even Yoda realised his mistakes and that something terrible and inevitable would happen.\n\nBefore Disney took over, the Light side of the Force was seen as the true way of the force, and it's refreshing to see that Disney is taking the more balanced approach.\n\nThe Force has no bias, the Force has no favorites. Jedi or Sith, the Force will always try to balance itself out.\n\nIf you look at it, Order 66 was that return to balance. The Jedi spent hundreds of years sending Force sensitive children on a path many of them would not have chosen if they had the choice to join in the first place. The Jedi unbalanced the Force, and so did the Sith.\n\nFrom what we've seen Gray Jedi mostly wish to maintain the balance of the Force, at all costs. They aren't slaves to the Republic or any form of government, nor do they wish to rule over others.\n\nThat being said there have been Gray Force users who share the mentality of \"The Force is more of a tool\" although those Force users were more likely more connected to the Dark Side, since viewing the Force as a tool has traditionally been a Dark Side mentality.","label":0}

I was caught off-guard by it all and as time passed that became increasingly difficult for me to bear, I became a cowardly person who evaded and denied the issue. I am ashamed and sorry.

You know, whenever this mythical next game or character happens...\n\nHowever, I've been inspired to make this old man be some other party member's grandpa, who has decided to protect their grandchild by emulating the 'ways of the Old Country.' They'd use their primal love for their family to fuel their rages.\n\nTo that end, I was thinking of going with the [Barbarian's Fearsome Defender archetype](http:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/fearsome-defender-barbarian-archetype\/).\n\nThough I'm also *really* considering going into the [Furious Guardian prestige class](http:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/prestige-classes\/other-paizo\/e-h\/furious-guardian\/) anyways, which I could just as easily do as a Bloodrager... Might not be as effective as pure Bloodrager, but the prereqs would come just as quickly.\n","label":0}

{"comment":"&gt; There's a reason games focus on PvP, progression, customi**z**ation and different game modes.\n\nNot all games. Maybe games *you* play (and what 13-yr-olds around the country clamber to play), but not *all* games.\n\nName one other popular boat simulator game out there. Can't? Then this game *in the least* is hitting an open market and can dictate what that market looks like.\n\n&gt;What's the end game currently?\n\nI'll agree that hitting Pirate Legend leaves quite a bit of 'what next'. I'm looking forward to when they handle that predicament. That said, they did make it easier to hit Pirate Legend with Doubloons, which is nice.\n\nLet me tell you one thing that this game has *not* done that a majority of the gaming industry is doing. Shoving microtransactions down our throats. Making us purchase season passes. Content updates locked behind paywalls. Yes, there is a plan for purchasable elements (like pets), but nothing at the scale of what the rest of the industry does. There's no loot boxes. You play and earn what you earn.\n\nAll of that said, *yes* I wish there was more to the game. But there isn't, and there wasn't, and we all knew what we were getting when we played the Beta\/Pre-release and then purchased the game. Some people thought there was more once hitting Pirate Legend (I did), but we all knew it would take quite a while before hitting Pirate Legend (which it would have before Doubloons were introduced). I, for one, enjoy what I got and am appreciating the content releases. It's what I paid for and expected.\n\nIf you find it entertaining to come onto the forums and moan about how there's nothing new that *you* like, then you're going to have a bad time. The game simply isn't what *you* or even 'mainstream' are wanting, and that can be okay. They have been listening to the community, know that there's room to grow, and I expect improvements to it.\n\nFinally, let's not forget the circumstances this game came out under. It was basically a flag ship product for the Microsoft Game Pass. It's going to operate as such. People who wanted to pay full price for *exactly what RARE marketed and Beta'd* were free to do so. Everyone had the power to know **exactly** what they were getting. If you didn't, then that's on you.","label":0}

{"comment":"&gt;all these evil, money-hungry, \"slit their own grandma's throat for a buck\" companies are just going to eat the loss or raise the cost of mac &amp; cheese by a penny to keep it cheap. Right...\n\nFirst, I never called them evil.  Don't get me wrong, I never called them good either, but don't ascribe hyperbole to me that I never supplied.  I don't blame them for wanting to have the lowest costs they can, because that's the point of their existence.\n\nSecond, the competition in the market drives prices.  There will always be someone who can make it for less, and will sell it for less.  It's why Marketing was invented (to be able to charge more, and allow the consumer to justify paying the higher price to themselves), and I was speaking purely from numbers and affordability on the side of the producer.\n\n&gt;the fact will remain that if we see this type of rapid increase then the living wage of minimum wage will only last about a year before hyper-inflation really kicks in.\n\nWhich is why no sane government will enact an immediate 25% raise in minimum wage.  They increase it gradually over a period of years to allow for companies to adjust over time.\n\n&gt;Well look where we are now! Insurance premiums are up a crap-ton\n\nFind me a source that isn't anecdotal, and I'll consider your point.\n\n&gt; everything is made in China and Mexico\n\nThere are signs pointing towards manufacturing returning to the US.\n\nhttp:\/\/online.wsj.com\/news\/articles\/SB10001424052702304587704577333482423070376\n\n&gt; that's what liberals say every time we slap a new environmental regulation or increase corporate income taxes or reduce tarrifs...\n\nActually, they say a lot of things, and that's not the only argument out there.

Sadly.\n\nThe court records are public record, so you could look it up and see, but they aren't easily accessible unless you are a lawyer.  You may have to travel to the original jurisdiction to get them.  You may be able to write to the court, but I am not sure.  Check their web page.  If you pull records, you want the grand jury indictment, the arrest report and the plea bargain\/conviction and any terms of release.  (My exH hasn't been released yet, so I don't know what those papers look like.)  That is one way to get around the gaslighting.\n Here is what the totally independent 3rd party said.\n\nI totally hear you about the \"Christians\".  I am dealing with the \"Grace and Forgiveness\" brigade, too.  He raped an 11 YO girl, but those of us who cut him out of our lives are the Bad Christians\u201a\u00d1\u00a2 for not accepting that serving his time means all is forgotten.\/s\n\nOn to practical matters, is the room where you store your financial stuff separate from the rest of the house and behind a lockable door?  My mom had a housekeeper, but she had a keyed lock on her office door and would lock it when the housekeeper came over.  I don't mean one of those locks a screwdriver can pop.  I mean a real keyed lock.  You can get one fairly cheap and they swap out with the regular knob easily.  Back that up with a webcam (or 3) that covers the whole room.  You can also do an old phone that you stick to the wall with command tape.  May also want to rig the common areas of the house and the baby's room as well.  Won't prevent anything, but will help with prosecution if needed.\n\n\n   ","label":0}

{"comment":"I mean the downside of Overwatch having a story though is that its a crap story. The Overwatch team isn't very good at writing. They typically just pick low hanging fruit, and half the time they mess it up. They mess it up in ways that LEAGUE OF LEGENDS doesn't even mess it up. Here's how the Overwatch story team failed at their job, short form listicle style. 1. The original teaser video established an emotional tone for the Overwatch universe. Four named characters with unique styles and gear shoot at each other in an extensive battle, but no one is even hurt. So... this is a comic book universe, where people can beat on each other extensively, but no one dies. And yet... this rule is very inconsistently handled. Characters *with names* only die if its dramatically appropriate. Characters *without names* die all the time, including at the hands of the heroes. But killing named characters is supposed to be a big deal, morally speaking. This just doesn't work. Example- you can't establish Reyes dark side by having him shoot a guy when we just watched Genji slice up like fifty dudes and no one cared. 2. When the characters were originally released they had personality but no story or interpersonal relations. This led the fan community to IMMEDIATELY start crafting fan canon about who was friends with who, who had what personality, and so on. The established lore then tore this apart, little by little. Result? There's almost two sets of canon for the game- the official one, and a fan canon that's too powerful to entirely die. Easy example: Mercy and Soldier as Team Mom and Team Dad. Overwatch wants the fans to put Amari in the Team Mom role, but it just hasn't taken. And its not going to. The proper thing to do here would have been to establish these relationships when the characters were released so that fan canon would match real canon, or, if the lore had to be written after the release, to accept the more widespread fan canon as lore. Either is acceptable. 3. Overwatch creates Chekov's guns that never fire. Its first promotional video was literally about the Doomfist, a powerful weapon handed down from generation to generation and bestowing upon its wielder the title of Doomfist (does that never get confusing?), being handed down to a new wielder. Doomfist gets announced as a character, and... its not the guy we saw inheriting the weapon after demonstrating his worthiness to wield it. Its some other guy we've never met, and to whom we have no pre established connection. This not only makes the released character less resonant, it calls into question the canonicity of a preview video that everyone loved. In particular, because the way he obtains the Doomfist is by stealing it from the museum we JUST SAW Tracer and Winston defend. 4. Overwatch has no idea how to make emotional moments. The vast majority of the Christmas comic is objectively bad writing, precisely because of this. Look at two parts that are actually good. First, a single frame of McCree and Sombra drinking at the opposite ends of an otherwise empty bar. This tells us a lot about them as characters. They could be anywhere in the world, but they're here, together. But they're sitting far apart. No one else is at this bar. These are lonely characters who are clinging to each other for some small measure of company, but who aren't close enough for it to be enough. An excellent scene. Or, Mercy, smiling as she reads a letter in a mobile hospital. She is someone with emotional connections, but also a mission, and she is at peace with the choice she's made. This is great story telling in single panels. (Let's not discuss Widowmaker leaving a rose on someone's grave after we were explicitly told that she was too brainwashed to have those feelings- if she's broken her brainwashing why is she still evil? If she hasn't then why... ok, enough.) But then go back to Tracer's story. It sets up a basic Gift of the Magi arrangement. Tracer wants to find the perfect gift, but that makes her late, and all Winston wants is company. Aww, that's sweet. but wait. Now it goes down hill. Lets cover the minor issue first. The only reason we have to pair Tracer and Winston as Christmas Buddies is because of the preview video that is now... not canon? Because of the Doomfist thing? But most people will overlook that. The bigger problem is that Tracer isn't shopping for Winston. She's shopping for this total rando we've never met before. Presumably we're supposed to gush because they're cute together (maximal social justice internet points are earned via the romantic relationships of classically attractive lesbians), but, WE DON'T KNOW THIS PERSON. Ok, so maybe this is how this person is introduced? Well, first of all, we never see her again after this. So... she doesn't seem to matter much. Second, if this is how she's going to be introduced, this is the worst way to do it. The whole setup here has been a story between Tracer and Winston. The only thing Emily does here is cock-block the emotional payoff of the Winston story. And worse, she actively undermines it. She thinks the present is for her, when its really for Winston, making her biggest act in the story a self centered one. And it means that when Tracer and Emily finally show up at Winston's, the reader understands that from Winston's perspective these two were just late because of their own personal lives being more important to them than getting to his place on Christmas. What is the narrative arc here? Its just events, happening, and then its supposed to be a nice ending because Winston is too emotionally generous of a person to take offense so long as they show up at all? There's no emotional payoff here, and its so structurally confused that there are no easy fixes. Deleting Emily entirely is probably the best move. Have Tracer show up to Winston's like she's going to apologize for not getting him a gift, but while holding the gift from the family in the square. Have Winston immediately give her a present, and take the present from her. And have each present be something silly. Like, the box from the family is a scarf, because Tracer likes scarves. But it doesn't fit Winston. He thinks its for him and wears it to be polite because he is a civilized giant gorilla and doesn't want to look ungrateful, but it looks silly and the viewer chuckles. Meanwhile it turns out that he got Tracer something he automatically assumed she would love- a giant crate of bananas and peanut butter. Or just have her show up with nothing, and the comfort of her presence is all he wanted anyways. Put Emily somewhere else, in some other comic, and make sure her entire characterization isn't \"a lesbian who steals Winston's Christmas present.\" Let her DO something that shows why Tracer likes her! Or, delete her and replace her with a different EXISTING CHARACTER so that the relationship can develop further over time! Its ok to ship your characters! Pick someone really surprising, like, Tracer\/Mei. Tracer is outgoing and spunky while Mei is shy and reserved, which creates emotional interaction, plus that's TWO MORE CHARACTER TRAITS THAN EMILY unless you counts \"steals Christmas presents from sad gorillas.\" There's no one way to do this. Virtually anything would work. Except what they did.","label":1}

Another contributing factor is often times the manu. will use a slower buffer for the SD slot. Writing jpegs only to SD may help, but any use of the SD along with the CF slot will slow down your buffer (albeit, not always considerably).\n\n3) When you process photos you add information to them, thus increasing your file size.

If not, find something you can use to squirt the area with water while you pee, and afterwards too. Then pat dry with toilet paper or a towel. Your risk shouldn't be increased if you maintain good hygiene. Also, not sure if you're sexually active yet or not, but always pee after sex to flush bacteria out of the urethra.\n\nA UTI doesn't pose any risk to baby. Unless the infection became systemic, there's no way for the bacteria to get into your breast milk.\n\nThere's not a lot of evidence that cranberry can resolve a UTI, so if your doctor prescribes antibiotics it's important to take them. UTIs can ascend to your kidneys and cause pyelonephritis, which is a serious infection. Take the antibiotics as prescribed, but it's also safe for you to take probiotics as well. Take them an hour after taking the antibiotics and they'll help to keep your gut flora flourishing.\n\nCongratulations on your new baby!!","label":0}

{"comment":"I enjoy it because it's always an adventure. While penetrative sex is a wild ride, there's a sort of basic core similarity to the mechanics and physics involved. I always felt that this put some limits on my overall creativity, as opposed to going down on a girl. That's when I have true creative control, and have a whole world of variety in my approach. It's also means that I can listen more intently to her and how her orgasms etc work, which generally improves all sex. It's also the only sex act that I know that partners have bragged to other people about relative to my talents, so there's a certain degree of pride.\n\nWhat I dislike about it is all the expected sort of aches and pains that can go along with it. I've also had the problem of wearing partners out, to the point the sex was bad\/non-existent or I was generally left hanging so to speak. Like any sex act, there are people who like it more than others, and if with a girl who's rather blah on it, it's significantly less fun.\n\nI don't think there's any particular way to make people like it, outside of suggest it and give some mild direction - they may learn to enjoy what it does rather than what it is.

{"comment":"For starters, I use the term \"dungeons\" a little liberally in that I'm often using that as an umbrella term for any hostile environment where the party has a set objective. A \"dungeon\" can be a cave, a tomb, a haunted house, or even a dinner party held at a noble's estate the party needs to infiltrate. What connects all these is they have a strong mix of social, combat, exploration, and puzzles. That being said, my party likes to get a dungeon complete in one session. Here's what I usually do; * Multiple points of entry. They don't need to fight the front guards if they don't want to. Feel free to get creative on the alternates. That secret tunnel into the castle might seem like a safer bet but what if it starts filling with water? Anything's faster than combat so give them the option to avoid that whenever possible while also keeping the danger ramped up. * Optional parts of the dungeon. I try to hint through wall engravings or old texts what's in the different parts of the dungeon. This way the party isn't scouring the entire place for their objective but they'll still be aware of options that could be worthwhile. For example, they may find a room that has a magical sword in it, or they hear the prisoners are being brought somewhere. Give them stuff to skip. If they do it all, reward them. If they don't do it all, use that skipped content in your next dungeon. A lot of flavor and history can come through in this variety. * Use some kind of timer. This can be quite literally an hourglass or something like \"you need to rescue the baby dragon and return it to its mother by morning\" (actual objective I had). Either way, make some kind of dramatic impetus for the party. Even if it's a basic old treasure hunt, you can have a competing party somewhere in the dungeon they need to avoid or beat. Which brings me to my next tactic... * Make stuff happen! I'm not a huge fan of static dungeons the party can move through at their own pace. Instead, I like to make them as dynamic as possible. One of the first dungeons I ever ran was a wizard's palace where a giant ferret was running around mucking stuff up. The party really wanted to find a way to both capture and shrink the ferret down, so the started exploring for tools and potions even faster. * Make traps interesting or don't do them. You know the beginning of Raiders? The part where Indy has to swap out the idol is a good trap that requires skill. Even when Indy messes up, it's fun because he has to outrun a giant ball. You know what's not a fun trap? The dumb spikes that come out the wall that you need to be constantly looking for. Dumb spikes slow down parties and make them paranoid. Idols give them something to think about. And that should be enough to help you out. Overall, the key is that your dungeons are modular and dynamic rather than static. A dungeon doesn't need to be a bunch of caverns and traps filled with monsters. It's a micro-setting for story to take place.","label":0}

Even people in the middle of New York have internet problems (as i watch Louis Rossman rant about it). &gt;If the pirates do not buy it then they should not be allowed to play and steps should be undertaken to prevent this. I am more willing to buy a Denuvo than non-Denuvo game because of that. DRM is a bad way to enforce that though. What happens 3-5 years when the Developer\/DRM developer\/Servers are long gone? You're stuck with a backup copy that doesnt work then. You think they'd be allotting any resources to strip that DRM away when they're busy packing up boxes to close down shop? Or be forced to buy a remaster so that you have a compatible version that may or may not work (which is already a big pile of bullshit)?

{"comment":"This is a common misconception. \"The devil didn't make you do it, he only suggested it might be fun.\" Slaanesh isn't responsible for rapes, even those carried out in his name. The chaos God's are products of and feed off of the subconscious emotions of sentiemt races. A merchant angrily wants to attack a rival? Makes Khorne stronger. A peasant wants for a change in lordship so he'll stop being oppressed? Makes Tzeentch stronger. A healer wants to relieve suffering from a sickness or pestilence? Makes Nurgle stronger. Likewise with Slaanesh, the act of rape will empower Slaanesh, but he's not the reason it was done. Even his worshippers do these things because they want more sensations, which makes him stronger, not because Slaanesh told them to. The chaos God's are a byproduct of humans being horrifying humans, not a cause. I do agree that some of the huge models are a bit much. But like I said, if there was no chaos, there'd be no beastmen, Skaven, undead, daemons, wizards... Your Chaos Warriors, Chosen, Knights, Skullcrushers, and your ultra-powerful Lords\/Heroes wouldn't exist, leaving you just humans, like the empire, but without any of their tech or protection or tactics. Just a bunch of shirtless barbarians. I look at Chaos as the highly polished carnival-mirror held up to humanity. Shows and exaggerates the aspects of humanity polite society refuses to see. And the fact that humans collectively created and feed the Gods just by their basic, subconscious and involuntary urges shows how prevalent things like rage and violence, suffering and disease, vanity and depravity, and yearning for change of any kind really are in said polite society. It's not that Slaanesh makes people vain, power-hungry, narcissistic, rapists, cannibals, or whatever else; rather, it's that such an overwhelming number of people have either done, or wanted to do all these things that they generated and consistently sustain a God in the aspect of these depraved activities. I think that's wonderfully dark. At the end, as usual, we did\/do this to ourselves.","label":0}

I get completely grumpy and just count the hours until dear son's bed time. I know it's not the best thing to do. It does get better. And it sounds like you are doing the best you can right now.\n\nI would highly suggest getting some type of swaddle transition that allows little one to roll over and not feel so free. It's most likely he still hasn't lost his moro reflex entirely and that coupled with the sleep regression can be what's causing it. I got my son a [zipadee zip](http:\/\/www.sleepingbaby.com\/collections\/zipadee-zip\/products\/its-a-bugs-life). Unfortunately we didn't start my son in his until he was 7 months old, because we tried the Merlin Suit and swaddling when his sleep got really bad. He didn't roll while swaddled or in the suit, and I think that since he didn't have that freedom, his sleep was pretty bad. Right now I think we're going through the 8 month sleep regression. He's taking crap naps and waking up at 4 am, and teething on top of it all.\n\nJust wanted to add that I too had a bad day today. I was feeling like a failure, being sick on top of it all doesn't help either. So I totally understand how you feel. I just remind myself that it won't be like this forever, take it slow and if my boy needs to be held for a nap then I'll do it. When I hold him for a nap, it makes me slow down and just relax and let everything else slide. I understand it's not for everyone, and I know there's a million things I could or should be doing, but my son needs comfort for the moment.\n\nYou got this!

When you fight a captain the game has to load up a lot of captain-specific resources, so it could be a hard drive issue.\n\nThe easiest way to share your error log would be to post it here! Usually a BSOD dump will contain info about the driver or hardware that failed. Would help a lot. If you haven't already, configure Windows to create a Small Dump from BSODs (instructions here: http:\/\/mywindowshub.com\/how-to-configure-windows-10-to-create-dump-files-on-bsod\/) and let's see what it says.","label":0}

{"comment":"Oh god baby heads.... I forgot how creepy they are...\n\nThose are some pretty helpful questions! I think if I did end up wanting a child, I would adopt. Honestly the thought of being pregnant scares me almost as much as having a kid does right now. As for the family line, the family name is going to die with my generation. The only guy in my generation is gay, so unless one of the girls has a baby and gives it her name, it's just the bloodline. And the rest of my family breed like rabbits, so it's going to continue for a very long time. I guess what bothers me most is my parents absolutely love kids, and would make excellent grandparents, but I just think I'd be a horrible mother. There's a joke in the family that the \"good mom gene\" only shows up every other generation, and since my mom was good, I'd lack the gene lol. Not that I believe it, but it's been traced back pretty far, and it's kinda creepy how true it is actually. I'm an only child, so they're only hope of grand kids lies with me. And I do care what people think, too much to be honest, but that's something I'm currently working on.\n\nThanks for helping me think this through!

{"comment":"\"My name is Blake and my being here is intentional.\" Lucifer smirked. My eyes were locked into his. Completely black, no other colors or details could be seen. As I rose to my feet, he took a several steps forward; his hooves softly knocking against the brimstone. \"How could you be here intentionally?\", he spoke in a cool, smooth tone. \"I must admit, I'm flattered. Do explain.\" I struggled for words, despite having convinced myself I was prepared for this moment. My eyes fought to take in everything I was seeing. I was in Hell. Finally. Lucifer, God's most beloved Angel, stood directly in front of me. The object of my obsession. He stood roughly over 8 feet tall. He had red, ashy skin down to his waist where it gave way to thick, dark brown fur that lead to cloven hooves. Large, curved horns adorned his head like a twisted crown. It seemed as if he was cloaked in a dark shroud, almost as if he was radiating negative energy. But it was not negative to me. His presence was invigorating. \"You gave us free will. I wanted to thank you. I was allowed to choose to end my life because of you. I refused to serve and live the way He commanded us. I would rather live or suffer in your kingdom.\" Lucifer's never-ending smirk gave way to shock for only a moment, as if my words came unexpectedly to the Prince of Darkness. \"I must admit I'm surprised,\" he chuckled. \"As to why anyone would ever want to come all the way down here, a place of pure torture and anguish, just to thank me? Your previous existence was so wrought with dismay and sadness that you ended your life? I'm impressed.\" \"I hoped you would be,\" I whispered as a grin spread across my face. \"However, you may be disappointed to find one thing out..\" Lucifer tossed his head back in thunderous laughter before returning his piercing gaze back down to me. He took a few more slow, deliberate steps forward and knelt in front of me. Leaning in closer, he whispered back, \"and what would that be?\" \"I've come for your throne.\" I muster every ounce of courage and strength in what's left of my soul and reach for a large piece of brimstone on the ground next to me. It sears my flesh but I use the pain and smash one of his horns. It seemingly exploded at the point of contact, however broke clean in half, falling several feet and impaling the dirt. Lucifer roared and recoiled in pain. His eyes literally became engulfed with flame and he charged. Each tremendous step slowing time down, it seemed. I was focused. I had talked him off his guard and had the Dark Lord right where I wanted him. I quickly rolled to where the piece of his horn had penetrated the very brimstone and wrapped my fingers around the Devil's ivory. Evil surged throughout my entire body. Overwhelming. All-encompassing. Darkness. I could feel his energy. I was drunk with power. He turned quickly and in a black shimmer disappeared then reappeared directly behind me. I was able to anticipate his movements. How was this possible? It didn't matter. This was what I had prepared for. I spun about with supernatural speed and plunged his own horn deep into his chest. He dropped to his knees, trying as he might to pull the splintered horn from his chest, in vain. \"Do you know what you've done?! You've upset the balance..\" he gasped. \"I know,\" I said in the Devil's own deep, calm tone. His energy was being fed to me. I could feel my soul turning black. Small black horns began protruding through the skin on my head. The pain was excruciating, almost too much to bear. The pain was also enlightening. I found myself in it. I understood him. I gripped the quickly weakening Lucifer by his remaining horn and pulled his face closer to mine. \"Do not fret, I think you would be proud of my ambitions. I am going to do what you never could. I am going to burn Heaven to the ground.\"","label":0}

In the south, stuffing is stove top stuffing. It comes in a box. As much as I love stove top, this is not a thanksgiving dish. In the south, turkey and dressing is the main dish. The dressing is made from scratch with cornbread, choppped onion, turkey and\/or ham, mushrooms, and the juice from where the turkey and ham have been cooked. You will also want to put sage and pepper, as much as you want to taste. Also chopped boiled eggs and celery if you want. Before you bake it, it should be really soupy with all of the juices. You will bake it until it dries out most of the way. Some people prefer it really dry and some want it to still be moist. Where your housemate grew up will make a big difference in what he\/she will prefer. Good luck! And I have lots and lors of old family recipes that we use every year.

{"comment":"Even if most mutations are negative (they are actually estimated to be predominantly neutral in most eukaryote genomes), evolutionary adaptation still relies on beneficial mutations. For a trait like a slightly longer neck to be heritable over successive generations, it has to have a basis in genetic specification. And variation in genetic specification has a mutational origin. In other words, all the different versions (alleles) of a gene in a lineage have a mutational origin, by definition. (There are epigenetic mechanisms that allow inheritance of a non-mutational, acquired trait over a limited number of generations, but there is no evidence these play a significant role in evolution.) To an evolutionary geneticist, the word \"mutation\" doesn't even necessarily imply a change in a gene. It could be in a gene, or a non-coding or regulatory sequence. Most of the human genome is non-coding sequence. Even within a gene, mutations can be synonymous and result in no change to the expressed product.","label":0}

Eventually Boca tied in the second off a set piece.\n\nThe resulting penalty kick shootout, taking place in front of the Holocausto del Norte, Once Caldas' superfans, gave Juan Carlos Henao a chance to showcase the same thing he did all tournament: his stake as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the world at the time. He blocked two penalties, the second of which secured the win for Once Caldas, their first Libertadores win and only the second time a Colombian club won the tournament (Nacional winning in 1989).\n\nThis is a moment that still makes me tear up when I watch it, in fact I teared up watching it just now. This subreddit is filled with so much of the same European soccer, which is just fine, but I hope to show something people here may not know about.\n","label":1}

Until that point were the perfect little example of what a family should be according to them.

{"comment":"[The Mayo Clinic](http:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/nutrition-and-healthy-eating\/in-depth\/vegetarian-diet\/art-20046446) (a highly-respected, non-profit medical organizations) says:\n\n&gt;A well-planned vegetarian diet is a healthy way to meet your nutritional needs. Find out what you need to know about a plant-based diet.\n\nThe [American Journal of Clinical Nutrition](http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/89\/5\/1627S.full) says:\n\n&gt;A vegetarian diet is associated with many health benefits because of its higher content of fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, potassium, magnesium, and many phytochemicals and a fat content that is more unsaturated. Compared with other vegetarian diets, vegan diets tend to contain less saturated fat and cholesterol and more dietary fiber. Vegans tend to be thinner, have lower serum cholesterol, and lower blood pressure, reducing their risk of heart disease. However, eliminating all animal products from the diet increases the risk of certain nutritional deficiencies. Micronutrients of special concern for the vegan include vitamins B-12 and D, calcium, and long-chain n\u201a\u00c4\u00ec3 (omega-3) fatty acids. Unless vegans regularly consume foods that are fortified with these nutrients, appropriate supplements should be consumed. In some cases, iron and zinc status of vegans may also be of concern because of the limited bioavailability of these minerals.\n\nSo, yes, you need supplements, but can certainly be healthy.\n\nBritain's [National Health Service](http:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/Livewell\/Vegetarianhealth\/Pages\/Vegetarianhealthqanda.aspx#age) (which has an interest in promoting health to reduce costs) says:\n\n&gt;As long as they get all the nutrients they need, children can be brought up healthily on a vegetarian or vegan diet.\n\nThere is simply no support for your assertion that a meatless diet can't be as healthy (and that's without considering the potential health and other societal benefits).\n\n","label":0}

It was very interesting how it's done and even more interesting how many people are trusting him with that information.\n\nAnyway, from what I know, this doesn't count as scene because it's not really \"cracking\" the game.

That isn't your computer, it belongs to the company you work for, not you.\n\nWhat he did was a little bit \"dickish\", but it's not an invasion of privacy and it's probably not even against company rules.  As your boss, he's probably allowed to log into your computer and check out what you're working on.\n\nThat log that had lists of accounts and who's brining in what... that might have been confidential information.  If I were you, I would talk to the person who gave you that list, and tell them that your boss logs into your computer to check up on you and tell them that he took the document and took it to his desk.  That *might* get him in some trouble, but I doubt it.  BUT, if he's snooping through your shit, the people who are supplying you with those documents should at least know that he's snooping.\n\nAs far as him shooting the messenger... yes, that's exactly what's happening.  And guess what? Welcome to the world of office politics, because that happens all the time, and it will happen to you a hundred times a year for the rest of your life if you work in an office.  He sent that email complaining about you working on that project because those kind of \"bitching\" emails are usually the catalyst for affecting change, and you just happen to be caught in the crossfire.\n\nOnly advice I can give you is, if it's not in writing, it doesn't exist.  That's how the office politics game works.  You can't go back later on and say \"well, I said this and he said that...\" It doesn't work.  If it doesn't exist in writing, it doesn't exist.\n\nSo, you should have responded to that email by hitting \"reply all\" and saying something along the lines of \"I've been asked to work on this project by so and so, if you feel this project is interfering with my other work or causing a distraction, that's something you'll need to take up with so and so, because I have to do what I'm told.\"\n\nDon't just read emails and get butthurt about them, respond to them, and be fair and careful and measured, but within those constraints, stick up for yourself and defend yourself, and whenever possible, do so in writing and do so in the most public way possible.","label":1}

{"comment":"A lot of outdated tips here, 9 is the most specialised position on the pitch, it's gonna be tough.\n\nDon't listen to what they're saying about planting your feet out towards whichever way you're passing. It's outdated and restricts passing the other way if need be.\nMOST IMPORTANTLY- DON'T WIND BACK WHEN PASSING. You must generate the speed by moving your arms forward- if you go back and wind up, someone will bat the ball out of your hands, particularly in scrums. Practice by placing the ball up against a wall- that'll help. Shit, if you've never played 9, you're not that good at passing. Your pass needs to hit the 10 everytime. Remember to stay low if the ball's on the deck- If you rise-up when passing, the ball's gonna go in the same trajectory.\n\nOn D, you're not the first line- as the ball goes out wide, shadow behind the back-line, incase someone cuts back in, then it's up to you and the flankers. You're gonna have to be a pillar a few times, you're just gonna have to suck it up.\n\nBE IN CONSTANT CONVERSATION WITH YOUR 10. If he's not talking to you, you should be talking to him.\n\nYou should always be aware where the back 3 are going forward- a cheeky dink into space or touch moves your pack forward and takes pressure off- discuss it with your 10 before KO.\n\nON LINEOUTS; Don't stand wherever. Stand on the 5 and follow the ball back as it goes- if it drops into the 5 area it's your ball.\n\nSCRUMS- talk to your 2 about the put-in before the match, whatever he wants. Also if it's moving, don't put it in- tell the ref, it'll be reset or he'll tell you to put it in.\n\nIt's up to you to tell the forwards where to go on D.\n\nYou'll be grand, just hit your 10 everytime\n","label":1}

If it's just a hunch then fine so be it just say that, but I've presented actual stats and trends and discussion on why I would think differently and all you've rebutted with was that I was wrong and a slave to ADP or something.\n\nYou haven't tried to explain anything. Your only explanation has been \"I don't follow ADP\" or \"I just liked those guys.\" That's fine, but when I ask for actual, logical reasoning you continue to ignore the request and try to play it off like I'm just a rankings drone (ignoring all the facts and stats I presented to support my ideas).\n\nNot once have you actually provided reasoning.

He hasn't even begun to direct that to Sanders.\n\nIf Sanders were the nominee, Trump would hammer him relentlessly on a number of topics including being a socialist and wanting to raise taxes to support more handouts. These are obviously not fair characterizations, but it wouldn't matter.\n\nThe reason is that the average U.S. voter doesn't have any sort of a nuanced perspective. The distinction between democratic socialist, socialist and communist will be lost in campaign rhetoric. And who wants higher taxes? I mean, nobody wants them, and the people who think alleged handouts are wrong will have a huge problem with higher taxes.\n\nI don't know what the process is if a nominee needs to drop out after the convention, so it is entirely possible, maybe probable that Sanders would get the nod.","label":0}

I think that the NDP would have had an easier job justifying unilateral reform, because they laid out which system they would switch to.\n\n&gt;For me, the most important thing is to prove that the new system accurately translates popular vote % into seat % while also giving a chance to vote for long shot candidates using a ranked voting scheme.\n\nThis is a good illustration of my problem. Many people are more concerned with vote splitting, and outright oppose any reform that would bring about perpetual minority governments. I think that by having such a vague reform plan, people really did project their own thoughts onto the Liberal plan.\n\n&gt;The US distribution might be a good idea here. The senate has 2 senators from each state regardless of population, while the house is divided by reps\/pop. Seems like that might be a good ideal representation system for Canada's two houses.\n\nAny change to the Senate's distribution would require a Constitutional amendment.

{"comment":"I primarily tour with an older Arcteryx Khamski 38 (I think it's the 2012-2014 version). It's a little larger than I typically need but that actually makes life easier because my gear isn't packed in tightly, so rummaging around is easy. I cut a bunch of unnecessary crap off, cut a drain hole in the avy pocket, and removed the uncomfortable aluminum stays and that brought the pack down to a very light weight.  No hipbelt pocket though so I'm using an aftermarket pocket I've attached. Still pretty annoying though. And the hipbelt itself is silly.  The padded section is too small to be of any benefit at all. I've got a fairly slim build and yet the hipbelt doesn't even reach around to my hip bones.  They should have either extended the padding 4\" longer on both sides of the belt or not bothered padding it at all and just leaving the entire thing as a length of flat 2\" nylon webbing.\n\nI also have the new 2016 BCA Float 32. It's a much, much better pack than the older versions.  The new adjustable back panel is WORLDS more comfortable and actually fits me, unlike the prior versions which I simply couldn't (wouldn't, actually) wear.  Capacity is good, pockets are relatively well thought out. Overall it's a great bag. I'm probably going to sell it though. I don't think the benefits of an airbag pack are worth it to me. I primarily ski the trees so it doesn't offer me much increase in safety. And I've got other things I'd rather put the money into.","label":1}

Though the howling winds blow flurries of snow against your face, you and your party press on. The sound of a crack splintering across the ice freezes you in your tracks more than the biting cold ever could. Looking down at your feet and the splintering crack, you glimpse it through the crystalline ice. A form so monstrously gargantuan it boggles the mind, a skull the size of a house, lying frozen for an eternity beneath the surface.*\n\nHey all, I wanted to do a study on painting ice, and what started as a doodle turned into a map. In the end, I'm pretty please with how I was able to render the ice, and I hope you enjoy this spiritual twin of the Dragon's Rest map I posted so long ago.\n\nI've got another map coming in a couple days, and a much more festive one than this.

{"comment":"The problem with flush mounting is generally related more to mechanical rather than electrical issues. A flush mounted component is likely to be a more appropriate size, and generally less likely to be broken off by vibrations and so on. Unless you're working on some kind of high end test gear or radio device, I suspect anything will actually work as long as the ESR characteristics of the caps are the same. In some switching applications, for example, a cap with inappropriate ESR values can result in the circuit not working at all, but again that's a component spec problem rather than a lead length issue. In other words, lead length isn't a major problem in most cases. Make sure the ESR is appropriate for the application, and make sure the cap is supported or glued so it won't snap off under its own weight.","label":0}

Indeed they do prevent some businesses from entering the market, but I don't think that it is considered a monopoly.

{"comment":"Considering the track record the team had at that point, struggling to make shots on a consistent, nightly basis, Kobe was the only one playing consistently exceptional. In crunch time, with the season potentially on the line, if you're Kobe Bryant, are you really going to kick it out to Pau for a 20footer (arguably you should cause that boy Lee can't play a lick of defense) or into the post with Howard so he can fumble the ball into a TO or go to the line and brick 2 shots? The team was a joke, a shell of what it could have been due to a lot of factors (injuries, team's dissatisfaction with Dantony, etc).Kobe could get to the rack and score most of the time regardless of what the defense threw at him. Maybe things would have changed once we got to the playoffs and the he would have started to share more, but it was gut check time. Who knows what we could have done in the playoffs, probably would have been a tall order to get past SA anyway even with a healthy squad.\n\nAlso, imo, it's rather foolish to turn down an opportunity to play with arguably one of the greatest players in the HISTORY of the game just so you can \"be the man\" on some other team, or cause you can't wait 2-3 years. You think the Lakers aren't going to sign big names in the off season or put together a squad around Howard just 'cause Kobe's here? Maybe he wins in Houston, maybe he doesn't, but you can count on the Lakers organization to at least continually bring in new talent and have the money to spend on the right players.\n\nLastly, yes it was a poorly officiated game, but GSW fans need to stop crying over it. You were already going to the playoffs, there wasn't too much riding on this game for you. There were plenty of other poorly officiated games all season not necessarily involving both or either LAL or GSW. You had a solid squad. You have an even better squad now. I love the team but can't stand the fans, I feel like the majority of them have this psychotic little-brother mentality \/ permanent underdog that they're always trying to point out the Lakers flaws or rub ever Lakers loss or GSW win in our face and I'm tired of it. You are no longer an underdog. I think GSW will be a legit WC champ contenders. It's time to seize the throne and stop looking at how everyone else in the league shortchanged your team for x number of years.\n\nTl:DR: Kobe did what he had to do to get the Lakers in the finals, Howard made a mistake in turning down the opportunity to play and potentially win with a legend, and GSW needs to stop whining and start winning.\n\nI'm aware this isn't a popular opinion\/I will be crucified by everyone who hates the lakers.

{"comment":"Reposting an old comment about this same subject I typed up a few years ago:\n\nI worked out the math on what the RPM is. The wheels of UP-844 have a circumference of 20.91 feet. Traveling at 60 mph the wheels spin at 252 RPM. Traveling at 70 MPH the wheel RPM is 294. The locomotive was built with to a design limit of 110 MPH, and then a safety factor on top of that so it is well within safe operating parameters. At 110 MPH the RPM is 463.\n\nAnother interesting thing to explore is the mean piston speed. This gives a general indication of how \"wound out\" an engine is. Until recently the Honda S2000 sports car had the highest mean piston speed of any production car: 25.2 m\/s or 82.6 feet per second.\n\nThe formula for mean piston speed is 2 * Stroke * RPM \/ 60\nUP 844 has a stroke of 32 inches. At 60 MPH the mean piston speed is 6.8 meters per second or 22.4 feet per second. At 70 MPH the mean piston speed is 26.18 feet per second. At 110 MPH the mean piston speed was 41 feet per second. That is roughly half that of the S2000 sports car.\n\nBecause high RPM puts a lot of stress on parts, steam locomotives designed for high speed service like UP-844 had large driving wheels. These tall wheels keep the RPM and piston speeds to manageable levels for the materials they were working with.\n\nThey are amazing machines.","label":0}

They're also a necessary evil to make sure that the battle times out in the event of a server disconnect.  They're not going anywhere, anytime soon.\n\nWhile I get that you want to be able to take on higher tier raids in a solo player environment, this would be the least elegant answer.  If you're proposing it because you're in a rural area and engage in one of these timerless battles, you could run out of revives\/potions and lack the ability to spin sufficient pokestops to restock.  You'd essentially be locked out of the gym system until you've spun enough stops or use up your pokemon.\n\nImagine a new player attempting one of these battles.  He's wiped out of inventory and didn't know he was trying to do something impossible for 2+ hours.  Not ideal.\n\nIf you think that's not possible, a guy I was raiding with didn't pay attention to everyone saying back out, or the conversation long there after, and attacked into a tier 5 raid solo.

{"comment":"Your description sounds logical... but there are definitely people who feel \"gender dysphoric\" without wanting to change their sex organs. Honestly, I think that having a very strict gender-versus-sex perspective when it comes to something as amorphous as identity isn't really helpful. People differ in how salient gender is to them, which means they have weaker or stronger mental representations of gender (neural connections between genders and attributes\/sex characteristics\/aspects of presentation\/sex roles\/etc. etc. etc.). It doesn't matter if these representations are the products of socialization, nebulous, and independent of biology; they still exist. (\"We believe that we invent symbols; the truth is that they invent us\"--I think the reality is somewhere in between, but it's worthless to pretend that we have total control over all the neural associations we develop, especially in early life. How easy is it to comprehensively and universally define most concepts that are important to us, really?) People differ in how strongly they personally identify with those representations of either gender. (Some research has shown that gender identity becomes stronger as a function of its importance to social group membership.) And people differ in how much it bothers them when others' views of them don't match their own internal identity--and it absolutely does not matter whether their representation of their identity is purely \"logical,\" as long as it's salient to them. For example, people who score higher on narcissism are more likely to feel acutely distressed when circumstances or other people contradict their self-views.

{"comment":"I don't know the math, but if the goal is to mine the base out faster, mule it all you want.\n\nActually for fun, let's do the math.\n\nAn SCV mines at around **~59** minerals per minute on a blue patch. When stacked efficiently of course. This means a gold patch is around **~83** minerals per minute.\n\nA mule in LOTV (since the economy change of 30 per trip to 25) mines at around [3.8 times as effectively as an SCV.](http:\/\/wiki.teamliquid.net\/starcraft2\/MULE_\\(Legacy_of_the_Void\\)) That comes out to 225 minerals per minute on all patches. ^^^We ^^^can ^^^double ^^^check ^^^this ^^^with ^^^a ^^^64s ^^^lifetime ^^^of ^^^a ^^^mule ^^^returning ^^^225 ^^^minerals ^^^anyway.\n\nOn a blue mineral line 4 patches are 900 and 4 are 1800 for a grand total of **10800** minerals per field.\n\nFor gold bases there appears to be a little variance. Odyssey has 4 patches of 600 and 4 patches of 1000 for a total of **6400**, but Battle on the Boardwalk has 3 patches of 900 and 3 patches of 1800 for a total of **8100** minerals. I think we'll just go with Battle on the Boardwalk and ignore Odyssey since Avex intended for it to be an innovative economy map anyway. ^^^did ^^^you ^^^know ^^^it ^^^had ^^^10 ^^^mineral ^^^patches ^^^in ^^^the ^^^main ^^^in ^^^the ^^^original ^^^design?\n\nOne more thing, it's incredibly complicated to deal with the 2 different mineral patches, since they'll mine out in half the time. And with different muling options, the sheer amount of math is too much for me to want to put effort in. We're just going to assume all the mineral patches have equal amounts to make the math easier.\n\nSo, a pure SCV mining blue mineral field will mine out in approximately **686s**.\n\n(10800 \/ (16 * 59) ) * 60 = **686**\n\nA gold base will mine out in **488s**.\n\n(8100 \/ (12 * 83) ) * 60 = **488**\n\nNow the fun part is adding mules to the equation.\n\nWe'll go with 2 Orbital Commands. It takes roughly 63.5s to generate enough energy to call down 1 mule. Lucky for us, it's close to that 60s rate for our SCVs. We can just double our mule rate and not have to worry about anything.\n\nEvery 60 seconds, 16 SCVs and 2 mules will mine out **1394** blue minerals.\n\n(10800 \/ ( (16 * 59) + (2 * 225))) * 60 = **465**\n\nFor a gold base, the SCV rate changes, but the mules stay the same.\n\n(8100 \/ ( (12 * 83) + (2 * 225))) * 60 = **336**\n\nNow we check efficiency.\n\nOn blue patches, you get a **~147%** efficiency with mules. ^^^mules ^^^are ^^^extra ^^^income, ^^^that's ^^^why ^^^it's ^^^&gt;100%\n\n(686 \/ 465) * 100%\n\nOn gold patches, you get **~145%** efficiency with mules.\n\n(488 \/ 336) * 100%\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nI didn't really expect it to be that similar too be honest. I believe I did the math right, but I could be off somewhere. It seems in the most minute detail, mining a gold base with mules will not hurt. You of course, gain the same minerals regardless how efficient you mine it.\n\nI think you can freely mule anywhere you like and not have to worry about it.\n\nThere is still the time until mining out to think of. It takes significantly less time to mine out a gold base with mules than to mine out any other base. Several minutes difference even. That's pretty huge on a map like Battle on the Boardwalk. Specifically for a map like that, I suggest muling the gold like you have been. But beware the loss in gas income. Gas mines the same on all bases, and losing 2 gasses like that is likely to hurt you in the long run.\n\n\n^^^Bonus! ^^^On ^^^Odyssey ^^^you ^^^get ^^^only ^^^**~134%** ^^^efficiency! ^^^How ^^^weird ^^^is ^^^that?","label":0}

It was about furface, and it involved someone being nice to her, getting a clean cloth and wiping one of those gooey sleep blobs that dogs get in their eyes sometimes out of one of hers. I think we (furface and I) had gone to a place to see about doggie daycare or a place space or something for her. When she came in, she greeted the person running the place very nicely and he went to get the cloth and came back and cleaned her eye and then she stood up on her hind legs and gave him a hug around the neck.\n\nThis isn't something she does (standing up on hind legs and putting front feet on people) and she isn't tall enough to do that to people. I saw [this picture](http:\/\/a137.idata.over-blog.com\/500x667\/0\/19\/24\/98\/optical-illusion\/tete-de-chien.jpeg) last night in an email from an older loved one.

I remembered the scene in an instant, knew in that same instant that it had never happened, and so then \"knew\" it had been a dream. It all happened so very quickly, but at the same time I could distinguish each part (seeing her, her face, and her eyes; having the visual image in my mind of her getting her eyes cleaned and of the hug; and recognizing that it was a dream) .

People in general seem to have more trouble sticking up for themselves.\n\nIt's almost like defending someone else is easier because you are playing the role of the hero and that helps empower you, but when it comes to defending yourself, it becomes harder to defend yourself.\n\nThis happened with my friend.  She told me in high school she would protect her friends and younger sisters from bullies.  If anyone went after them, she transformed into the bitch you knew you had to run away from.  But when she was being picked on...let's just say she made Princess Peach look like a strong female.\n\nShe become better at standing up for herself now, but my point is that you're not alone.  Standing up for yourself and for others seem to be two different things, and being your own hero seems to be the harder of the two.\n\nI'd like to think that in that situation I would handle myself like John Wick, but I'm sure I'd be plenty afraid (I'm a guy by the way.  :P).\n\nSorry for the paragraphs but I'm sure that this has made you a little strong so if this happens again (hopefully it doesn't) you'll have a little more experience and will be able to handle it better.  :)","label":0}

{"comment":"What do you mean? Do you understand the difference in strength between an organization such as the NFL, or the NBA, and an organization such as Valve, Blizzard, or Riot Games? Actually Baseball might be better since they get a lot of players from poorer countries.\n\nThese organizations are huge, professional, and know what they're doing. They are constantly at the Visa offices working to get their new players the right paperwork. They have millions to spend to make sure everything is perfect. They are representing highly visible and public organizations. You tell a visa office you are going to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates they'll probably know what you're talking about. Tell them you're going to play for Team Liquid they might get a little more confused.\n\nEven if there is a legally available visa for \"Esports\" players, they have to prove they qualify. They have to prove they're employed by who they say they are, that the tournament they're going to exists, that they have been invited, and that, most of all, that when their visa is up, they will leave the country and return back to where they came from, after having paid all the necessary taxes for the money they earned, legally, here in the United States.\n\nThis is a huge amount of information and most young people are not really prepared for it. A lot of Esports organizations are run very sloppily, things like proof of employment might be hard to come by... lol.\n\nBecause, remember, if your story is false, you're just a young guy from a poor country that would probably love to get lost in the system in the US and hope that between having kids who are american and the potential for amnesty... that everything works out.","label":0}

{"comment":"&gt; The rust community sees the world purely in memory safety terms,\n\nRust is one of the easiest-to-refactor PL's that I've ever used. I've used many, but refactoring in Rust is changing an API, fixing compiler errors, and that's it. I don't even need to run tests to know that the refactor did not introduce any problems. It is also orders of magnitude better code-reuse wise than C++, proof is how hierarchical the ecosystem is. A high-level Rust crate has &gt;100 dependencies, anything like this in C++ would be a maintenance nightmare but in Rust it just works.\n\nAbout the other issues you mention... extra verbosity in unsafe functions is at most a one time cost, and if `emacs`, which probably has the worst Rust support of all editors out there, has already way better auto-complete functionality than most C++ IDEs, I really don't see how this can be an issue to anybody but those writing code in notepad or nano. One doesn't need to put a function in a trait to make it polymorphic, but using single traits has some benefits over plain generic functions, and writing one-off traits is idiomatic Rust. This one time cost is almost zero, I just have a snippet for one off traits and writing one takes zero time.\nEvery time I get a C++ substitution failure error with a 10 possible candidates overload set I think \"in Rust this error wouldn't have happened or be a one liner\", and this is exactly because of Traits.\n","label":0}

But it might be Trinity, Farrah, and Peppermint, who all share a color with other queens, but within the top 3 are distinct from the other two. So according to this theory then, if the top 4 were to be Peppermint, Valentina, Aja, and Farrah, then it would probably be Peppermint or Valentina going home because they share a color. Basically, no one is guaranteed to make top 3 just because they are in a color group, but it is very unlikely that two members from the same color group will be in the top 3 together.","label":0}

{"comment":"That seems to be the position shift many have taken. Yet, carbon retention in the oceans is basically just a theory. At different times in the earth's past, before we were around, there was more carbon in the atmosphere than today, yet things settled out and life flourished. Seeing as how we are all carbon beings, including fish, we might just survive! We should be focused on real problems like water pollution and over fishing instead of trying to combat carbon to save marine life. And the polar ice caps are NOT melting. As I said before they can detect the size of the ice pack with satellites. Since the 60's the polar caps have been growing! And emissions of CO2 have never been higher. When it is warm more water is evaporated off the oceans, carried by wind currents over the polar caps, and deposited as new snow. This is the planets way of rebuilding itself, so there is no need to fret about the script of Waterworld becoming reality. ","label":0}

(Cand a propus PMP legea in parlament, doar PMP si USR au votat). Atat ii pasa lui Iohannis de vointa populara. Interesul partidului peste interesul tarii. Asta face si Dragnea.\n\nMi se pare amuzant ca electoratul opozitiei e atat de antiPSD ca nu observa faptul ca la noi se face referendum, dar nu stim intrebarea (n-am mai vazut asemenea ridicol in vestul Europei). In general se porneste de la tema si apoi faci referendumul. La noi, invers. Iohannis ne arata pe fata ca ii pasa de jocuri electorale mai mult decat de masuri clare. Cica referendum pe justitie. Asta e o tema clara? Sau e doar o tema de incercat de castigat capital electoral?\n\nAsa ca tema asta cu \"PSDul incearca sa fure referendumul\" e de-a dreptul hilara in conditiile in care nu avem o intrebare pentru referendum.\n\nPS: Nu mai dati downvoturi aiurea, ca nu fac campanie pentru PSD sau PMP.

{"comment":"A funny secret, from my understanding, is its entirely orthodox to say the Eucharist is a symbol, but we avoid using that term in the modern west due to the baggage it comes with within our cultural context. The Eucharist is not a symbol in the sense its a metaphor. Its a symbol closer to how I believe Jung used the term symbols in the sense it is *something we can conceive of that points to a reality that we can't conceive*. With the added aspect of bringing these two together. So the Eucharist is a symbol in that it is something we can conceive of, pointing to something that we can not conceive. In this sense, the humanity of Christ itself is a symbol. But the Eucharist and the humanity of Christ are not metaphors or mere representations and reminders of a greater point, but instead they are real things we can conceive of pointing to real things we can not conceive of. Also I do believe that the Greek word for symbol has to do with throwing two things together, such as what can be conceived and what can't be (particulars and universals). And I may be misremembering but I do think the term Satan means to accuse, tear apart, divide so I think that is also a dynamic that needs to be kept in mind when reading the Church Fathers in order to understand what their words would have meant to them, but I may be mixing up the etymology of Satan with something different, but similar. tl:dr; The Eucharist as a symbol is not commenting on if the Eucharist is the real presence of Christ, but rather its commenting on the very real sacramental nature of the Eucharist which is not found in mere bread and wine nor in an act of remembrance.\u00a0","label":0}

{"comment":"Off the top of my head, the first four of these are encountered in spoken Urdu:\n\n1. Tukka: Means guess\/fluke. Can have many connotations which are hard to translate to English.\n\n2. Raunaq: A word which indicates liveliness of something\/some place.\n\n3. Takalluf: A word with many shades of meanings, primarily used to tell guests to not be reserved, in verb form. E.g. Takalluf mat kijiye, thora aur khaiye. = Don't do takalluf, eat some more.\n\n4. Jhuta: (adjective) food, drink, or some eating utensil from which something has been eaten\/drunk. E.g. Main kisi ka jhuta nahin khata. = I don't eat someone's jhuta. i.e., I won't eat from it if someone else has eaten from the dish.\n\n5. Goya: This is a word used in literary Urdu, with meanings like \"as if\", \"apparently\", and \"as though\". In one particular couplet of the Urdu poet Momin, the word goya makes it untranslatable into English.","label":0}

{"comment":"Well, this was a really exciting chapter.\n\nFirst things first, Kanae is an idiot. He's exposing the Tsukiyama family to more danger in a plan that is completely unnecessary to Shuu's plan. All he really needed to do was make sure that the Qs were distracted by some other task. If they're in danger, there's no way Haise will have any time to talk to Shuu, and he's likely to not trust him after he realizes that Kanae is his servant. This could be bad. I also wonder if that explosion at the end was Urie hitting him with his kagune, or if someone went to save him.\n\nAlthough, the plan itself wasn't a bad one, assuming the Quinx weren't that formidable. Kanae might have been able to take on Urie and Shirazu, if Urie hadn't been ghoul-pipe-steroiding it up for half a year. That scene with Urie slamming Kanae against the wall with his hand around his neck was super epic, even if I don't want Kanae to die right here.\n\nShirazu has some serious issues he needs to work through right now. Pretty soon, if not now, his remorse over Nutcracker's death will lead to his own demise. I have a feeling that he'll partially get over it, use the quinque, and eventually, either Kanae or some other ghoul will recognize it as Nutcracker, causing Shirazu to flip a shit again. It really is a morbid thing to think about, turning a living person's body parts into a weapon.\n\nI was really impressed with Mutsuki this chapter. He's been taking Suzuya's advice\/training to heart, and he's gotten a lot better with both his knives and confidence, although I wonder if Torso was toying with him, or if he just hasn't improved at all in the past 6 months (which is weird considering he's probably done a lot of missions since then). Hakatori looks interesting, design-wise, and the fact that she's Tatara's subordinate. She means business.\n\nLastly, Saiko is in deep shit right now. That guy\/thing looks scary af, and wasn't in Kanae's flashback, so he probably has some importance. In the past, if Ishida ended a chapter with a new character, they turned out to be important (Matsuri, Kijima). However, we still haven't seen how badly she wrecked Nutcracker with her Kagune back in the auction arc. Either she'll be forced to do something, or Haise might have to finish the white suits quickly and catch up to her.\n\nReally great chapter. Lots of development and action and payoffs all around. I'm pretty content.","label":1}

{"comment":"just for a perspective during brady's pre-superbowl champ year\n\n* he was carried as a 4th (starter Drew Bledsoe and backups John Friesz and Michael Bishop) qb for his rookie season. a useless-wasted-not even a place holder roster spot, simply because bb saw a great potential in him.\n\n* he eventually became the backup qb. but BB brought a backup qb competition for his 2nd year, he eventually won it.\n\n* he outplayed Drew during the preseason of his 2nd year in the league. he was not named starter due to lack of experience\n\nthere is no question that brady would have been successful whichever team he might have went to. it's just a matter of how much success he could have had. coaches looks at how a player (especially qbs) during practices if they are worth the roster spot. the fact that brady was able to jump from a 4th string to backup in under a year just shows that he has what it takes to be an nfl qb. the fact that he was able to outplay drew during the preseason of his 2nd year showed that he has what it takes to become a starting qb. if tom was drafted by other teams, it will only be a matter of time before he gets a shot at starting. he may not have had 4rings but you can bet that he would have been a successful nfl qb\n\n\nthis are the teams that picked a qb in the 2000 draft. so let's assume that this guys would have taken brady instead.\n\n**New York Jets** Chad Pennington\n\n**San Francisco 49ers** Giovanni Carmazzi\n\n**Baltimore Ravens** Chris Redman\n\n**Pittsburgh Steelers** Tee Martin\n\n**New Orleans Saints** Marc Bulger\n\n**Cleveland Browns** Spurgeon Wynn\n\n**New England Patriots** Tom Brady\n\n**Washington Redskins** Todd Husak\n\n**San Diego Chargers** JaJuan Seider\n\n**San Francisco 49ers** Tim Rattay\n\n**Denver Broncos** Jarious Jackson\n\n**Tampa Bay Buccaneers** Joe Hamilton\n\nmost of this organizations are a pretty solid landing spot at the time.

{"comment":"&gt; I'm so sick of people telling me I can ask girls out, because I can't freaking do it.\n\nI'm sorry, then you're going to be alone. Because you literally cannot date unless you put yourself out there and risk the rejection. Everyone gets rejected. Everyone. Sure, there are women out there who are really confident and will walk up to guys and ask them out. But a lot of us (me included) aren't comfortable doing that. What possible advice could you get other than to -- try. You can't just magically get a girlfriend without making an effort. So your anger here is ridiculous and unwarranted. So yeah, if you never get the nerve to approach a girl, you're going to die without ever kissing one\/having sex\/having a relationship. That's the cold, hard truth. You absolutely CAN do it. You just won't. The guys who can don't have some magic secret that allows them to do it. They just do it. There's no fate or no special trick to it, it's just a matter of finding the courage and asking.\n\nThe upside? Plenty of shy guys get the girl. My husband was really shy. Nerdy, even (I happen to like that, that's my type). He jokes that if we hadn't wound up together he'd have died alone because he doesn't have \"game\" but he didn't need it. He talked to me. He made me laugh, he showed me what an awesome person he is. Eventually, he made a move. And that was that. I knew we'd wind up together. He still says if it weren't for me he'd be alone but he's so much fun, everyone loves him and someone would snap him up in a heartbeat. You don't need to be particularly smooth or clever to get a girl to like you. You just talk to them like they're people (because they are) and show an interest in them and if you find a girl you like, you ask her out. I'm shy and awkward as hell (my husband thinks the awkward, weird shit I say is funny, luckily for me) too but I wasn't about to sit in my house and rot because I'm too scared to talk to people.\n\nIf you're truly so cripplingly shy that you cannot possibly approach a woman or ask someone out, then you need to talk to a professional about that.\n\nI also saw this in another comment here:\n\n&gt; I'm shy, too. When I say that to people, they laugh, because I no longer SEEM shy to people.\n\nThis is what my husband is like. To talk to him now, you'd never know that when he was your age, he was painfully shy, because he trained himself to talk to people (literally just by forcing himself to do it). Now he's that fun, laid back guy that everyone loves because he just forced himself until it became second nature. I knew him when we were teenagers\/early 20s and you could barely get 2 words out of him for the longest time. Now he'll chat up total strangers (if I leave him alone at a bar or something I'll come back and he'll be talking to random strangers and making them laugh by the time I get back). By nature he's a really quiet guy but when he needs to be he can be really gregarious, funny and engaging.","label":1}

Then, you tell the database to use that employee ID and go back to the roster table and get any info you want on-the-fly.\n\nLet me whip something up in Access real quick, I'll show you what we're talking about.

The relationship of a Bitcoin bank with a system that ultimately strives to remove them is one that tends to degenerate. Given disproportionate power, I have zero doubts that they'd kill Bitcoin as a censorship-resistant system. Simply because it's nothing but a short term limit to their business model, despite being the characteristic that makes Bitcoin make any sense at all. But if you look closely, the system doesn't need to make sense (see Ethereum). Smoke and mirrors can provide copious profits for a long time, before people inevitably realise there is no point. But this can take long enough that it makes no sense to worry about that, business-wise.\n\nI mean, they don't even have to agree with these diagnostics.

{"comment":"The crew teleporter is one of the most reliable offensive weapons in the game; used correctly there are few to no ships that can't be beaten. Using just weapons can backfire if you don't get any new ones; those starting lasers really start to struggle around sector three. My favored strategy with the red-tail is to rush the second shield bubble, maybe an engines upgrade, and then save for a teleporter. Using the starting mantis and one of the humans is more than enough to take out any ship you'll find early on. Once you have those things, getting some more shields and dodge is always a good idea, but try to keep around 80 scrap on hand to buy any weapons you might see. With the increased scrap from boarding, out won't br much trouble to keep ahead of the curve defensively. Remember to upgrade the doors, as there won't be many crew aboard your ship, so fire or boarders can get out of control quickly. The red-tail has a quite incredible venting layout, so even with only a couple crew boarders can be dealt with a minimum of hassle. Hopefully by sector four you've found a few new crew or a weapon, but if you don't all hope isn't lost. Your crew can really distract the enemy ship's crew when you board it, particularly in the shield room. This can cause them to remove crew from other, more important stations such as piloting, allowing your lasers to be much more effective. Using those lasers on any medbay they might have can give your boarders enough of an edge to keep winning for most of the game. Wait until their crew start to run away on low health, then shoot the medbay as they arrive. Anyway, sorry about the massive wall of text, but I've been maining red-tail for quite a while. Made me really want to share my thoughts on it. I can win a good bit more than half the time with it these days, around three out of four games. Good luck in your future attempts, the red-tail is quite a solid ship so you'll get it eventually.","label":0}

Just because something is better in one franchise does not mean it makes any franchise it is inserted into better. If i sit down to watch the harry potter movies, and the last two movies suddenly add light sabers from star wars franchise, i would be a little upset. Assassin's Creed was founded on RELIVING the lives of fictional ancestors not about fanfic'ing your own story into your ancestors life.\n\nEdit: Also it should be noted that there are ways of adding choice to the AC franchise without breaking the lore they established. For example, they removed sync from missions and replaced them with Black Box missions which allow you to play a mission the way you want to approach it.","label":0}

I answer pagers.\n\nAll kidding aside though, I have worked at a few different facilities (because I'm a traveler) and the circulator role encompasses different duties at each place (ancillary staff, policies, and other factors dictate how much actual work you have to do). You don't lose all patient interactions, that's just not true. However, it is extremely limited. As a cardiac circulator I would often inquire about general patient history, surgical history, and current medications (which is a huuuuuge factor in terms of surgery and anesthetic plan). Many of these questions were previously addressed through pre-op nurses and general H&amp;Ps, although patients aren't perfect and many times one missing piece of information is a serious matter, depending upon the nature of the information, that is.\n\nI could go on and on about circulator duties but many have been addressed.\n\nSource: CVOR\/Trauma\/you name it circ. at numerous level 1s across the country.

Bishop would probably have more issues with being a woman than Malcolm would have with a couple of years on her.\n\nI don't think that would be regarded as gutless.

He was required to \"abjure, curse and detest\" those opinions.[85]\n\n&gt;* He was sentenced to formal imprisonment at the pleasure of the Inquisition.[86] On the following day, this was commuted to house arrest, which he remained under for the rest of his life.\n\n&gt;* His offending *Dialogue* was banned; and in an action not announced at the trial, publication of any of his works was forbidden, including any he might write in the future.[87]\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Galileo_affair","label":0}

{"comment":"&gt; All the tanks reloads are provided by the game already\n\nAre they? during battle? where?\n\n&gt; BUT you are correct with saying when there are 4 tanks shooting you its nice to know the reload but realistically when do you put yourself in the situation where u are rolling up on 4 tanks and it matters what order based on reloading you have to kill them in.\n\nThis is the life of any heavy\/medium tank in the game that needs to push. You need to pay attention to everyone, usually 4 to five tanks a time, and those timers help A LOT. What about the flankers that were not on your screen when they fired? Can you keep track of their reloads too?\n\n&gt; Yeah its annoying if your in your e100 and you shoot and someone comes over and punishes your long reload but isnt that the way its supposed to be anyways?\n\nYes, that is exactly why I think timers are bad. You can punish everyone freely with no doubt they wont fire at you. Especially for autoloaders, who usually like to play the \"I'm reloaded\" game, but with the mod you know they are not.","label":0}

SKT T1 is an awesome team, and still one of the favorites to win it all, if Faker can carry smaller derps of Impact. It may seem biased, but I prefer Gambits A game over Fnatics, but that may have to do something with my preference of Gambits playstyle, and dislike of Fnatics. However, Fnatic looks really scary, and in direct comparison seems to win against Gambit since the last LCS split. Ozone is still a force to be reckoned with, if they can get their shit together, especially Dade and Mata. I really like LemonDogs playing, and love them for their ballsy Swain pick. Also I think Tabzz + Mithy is a really scary botlane. Vulcun showed really good performances against supposedly better teams (maybe except against Gambit), they just need to work on snowballing leads \/ not throwing. As much as I love TSM, I have concerns for midlane, if Regi gets his Karthus and Zed banned. Also there is always the possibility for WT or Dyrus to go on tilt if camped.

In other settings, this isn't always the case, but D&amp;D lore (especially earlier material) is very much in the Tolkien mode. Now, if you want your FRP to be more about postmodern moral relativism or explore human ethnocentrism and defend monster races as unfairly oppressed indigenous peoples because that's interesting and meaningful to you and your players, go ahead.

{"comment":"Well, actually its a good idea to circumcise.\n\nThere's evidence that circumcision reduces the risk of HIV infection in heterosexual males. See, the epidermis of the penis (the outer skin layer) Langerhans cells, which are targeted by HIV. If the foreskin is removed, the number of Langerhans cells is reduced.When an uncircumcised penis is erect during intercourse, any small tears on the inner surface of the foreskin come into direct contact with the vaginal walls, providing a pathway for transmission. When an uncircumcised penis is flaccid, the pocket between the inside of the foreskin and the head of the penis provides an environment conducive to pathogen survival; circumcision eliminates this pocket. Some experimental evidence has been provided to support these theories. There is also evidence that circumcision helps reduce the risk of UTI's, HPV, and penile cancer (the risk of penile cancer is low anyway, but still).\n\nIt's worth noting that there is a condition known as Phimosis. Men with Phimosis are not able to retract their foreskin over the head of the penis due to adheasions between the two. Normally, this goes away when you're a little kid, but can sometimes stick around into adolescence and even adulthood. If it lingers, this can cause serious discomfort when you get an erection. Circumcision can dramatically reduce the risk of Phimosis due to...you know, not having a foreskin.\n\nIf you're circumcised at infancy, the risk of complications is really low. Less than 1% of all procedures have had complications afterward.\nlow.

{"comment":"The best way would be to bring a printout of the website with you and, if you are asked if you have anything to say, adress this by yourself. As the quite prior states, the toll-officers have a scope of discretion what they let you take with you and what not, so, as long as you seem nice enough and have a valid reason why you have to carry this amount of medication with you, they might let you keep all of them. The danger of you being accused of drug-trafficing like this is basically not given. Just have a nice big paper-trail with you. Meaning you should have with you: The official acceptance-letter for 6 month, if you have the visa for 6 month, a note from your doctor about the necessaty that you have to take these, maybe printouts of some articles that discribe how difficult it is to get this medication in Germany, and so on. Basically, the better you can proove that you need this amount of medication and the more believable you say it to them, the more likly they let you keep it.","label":0}

I'd love to see the numbers for Planet of the Apes, but I don't think it amounted to be more than a million dollars or so in total merchandise sales.\n\nStar Wars took that to a new level where the royalties from the merchandising actually exceeded the box office profits.  Even the toy companies didn't really anticipate just how popular the toys would become.  I know this dates me, but when Christmas 1977 came around, Kenner Toys produced a printed piece of cardboard that you could purchase which included a form you could fill out to have them send the action figures to your house once they got produced.

{"comment":"Respectfully, I disagree.\n\nWhy would they distract from skill? Is it not considered skill if you can deal with, say, Palkia flipping the stage in Spear Pillar? Skill, in my opinion, is the ability to play the game period. If you can't deal with crazier stages, it suggests you aren't so much skilled at the game as you are skilled at a few particularly simple stages. Using the map around you to your advantage is just as much of a skill as your ability to juggle someone by dashing around with Fox.\n\nMore than that, if \"the better players would still win anyway\", then what's the problem? Let's get longer matches and crazier deaths, that's what makes the game fun. Watching the same people use the same moves over and over in a few quick matches isn't fun, it's boring. Longer matches suggest that players are more evenly matched, resulting in a more dynamic battle.\n\nI can respect your opinion if you don't like the stages, but I don't think simplifying the stages inherently makes players more skillful.","label":0}

From a fluff standpoint, confederating is one faction giving up all of their power to you and ceasing to exist - most factions thus do not ever WANT to confederate and will logically only due so when situations are dire.\n\nThus, if you have a treaty which garuntees you will support them militarily, they have no reason to confederate.\n\nI can absolutely confirm you can confederate multi-province factions in VH and legendary.  As skrolk, I confederated Skyre when they had three armies and four provinces.  Three of them were under siege, and I had specifically not allied with them in the hopes of confederating.\n\nEdit: replaced well-known with documented.

I'd say look at a few different blogs to get an idea of what you personally think looks nice. Decide if you want to show your thumb or not and so on, and then just practice for a while taking photos in a couple of poses you like and see what works for you. I just decided I wanted to show my thumb and I liked the nails all lining up, and I ended up with this. I tried another pose for ages that I liked from another blog but eventually realised it just didn't work for me, it always looked a bit funny and not nearly as good as it looked when the other blogger did it. (You don't have to copy someone but it's a good way to get ideas).\nFor lighting, I use a homemade lightbox (Chalkboard Nails has a tutorial) with a lamp on either side.

Their parents, wealthy and influential members of society, never pursued these rapists? That accuser \u201cknew\u201d the punch was being spiked and the guys raped the girls, but she went 10x?
