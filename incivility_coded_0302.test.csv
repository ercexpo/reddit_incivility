&gt;__Fufu__ (variants of the name include __foofoo__, __foufou__, __fufuo__) is a [staple food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food) of the of many countries in African and the Caribbean. It is made with a flour made from the introduced plant, [cassava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava), or alternatively, another flour such as [semolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semolina), or [maize flour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize). It can be made by boiling starchy food crops like [cassava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava), [yams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_(vegetable\)) or [plantains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantain_(cooking\)) and then pounding them into a dough-like consistency. Fufu is eaten by taking a small ball of it in one's fingers and then dipping into an accompanying soup or sauce. Foods made in this manner are known by different names in different places. However, __fufu__ stands out, especially in Ghana and in [West Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa) in general. Among [Hausa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_people) communities in [Northern Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Nigeria), it is known as __sakora__, __sakoro__ among the [Dagombas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagomba_people) of [Northern Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Region,_Ghana), and as couscous(*couscous de Cameroun*) in the French-speaking regions of [Cameroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon) (not to be confused with the North African dish [couscous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous)).

"And it's good to see drama with the understanding that drama is just an art form, the same as comedy and tragedy.  Although some things in life are like drama, life isn't drama.  There are people who think of life in terms of drama, and they see heroes and villains everywhere, which tends to create problems.  The kids in high school have an expression for these problems.  They call it  *drama*.  Tragedy gives you the inside story about bad people.  The crime show isn't about that.  It's about catching the bad guy.  (No matter how sympathetic we may be toward bad guys, they have to be caught.)  There's truth in drama, tragedy, and comedy, but life is life not any of these.  Life is life.

In ancient Greek plays, there's only talk about people who get killed somewhere else.  You don't see it happening, like in Shakespeare or modern plays.  Modern crime shows have a thing about decaying corpses shown in close-up that I don't get.  On the other hand, Buddhism isn't about pretending that bad things don't happen.

I had problems with my Vive from day one.  Every time I turned quickly, the screen would go grey.  No amount of fiddling with room setup, drivers or lighthouse placement seemed to fix this for long.  And then one day my power supply (a fairly borderline unit that was built into a cheap case) failed.  I replaced the power supply with a modular Corsair PSU (750W) and my issues went away entirely.  So I can only assume I was actually have issues power the USB ports for the Vive.

Obviously your mileage may vary, and I don't know if I'd be willing to replace a decent PSU on the basis of this advice, but it's not as crazy as some are implying.

"Aw nick, you are gonna make me cry Seriously though, you are pretty much singlehandedly responsible for getting me into knives. The first video I watched of yours was your review of the Boker urban trapper. I was looking for one (read ONE) pocket knife that I could carry. Your loss of all the bearings scared me. I came across your Kizer Dukes video and bought one. That was my first good quality folder, and I still have it today. After that video I have watched all yor your videos at least once and jump on all the new ones. It is safe to say that you have ruined me financially (joking!) Seriously thank you for your videos, and please never stop uploading. You have made me think about all the tiny things on a knife that make it gem or junk. Thanks!",0

"Being consistent salespeople is great, but I just think it is easier for the parks gang to transfer their government experience to the private sector. I think that maintaining those accounts isn't as difficult as some of the things that the parks people had to do.

Also, some of the things you see as successes I don't view that way, as they ended in more examples of bluffing or lucking their way out of situations. The Michael Scott Paper Company wasn't really a success just because they got bought out. They were reaching a point where the company wasn't sustainable and selling was the only option or else the company would have folded. Their mission when striking out on their own wasn't to sell the company off at some point, it was to compete as a company. And they pulled some clients by providing rates that they literally had no hope of sustaining, and the office crew that remained were losing clients to this three man popup tent operation.

Ryan wasn't a success either, it was more bluffing his way into a spot he couldn't live up to. Yeah he got to be an executive. He was then shortly after arrested for fraud and ended up working at a bowling alley. He's a con-man, not a success. That wouldn't fly in the Pawnee government setting for long as the town was constantly trying to oppose or take down government projects by any means necessary. And sure, the people you mentioned as being gifted salespeople were just that. But look at the energy and focus levels they had. They were all ready to get out of the office whenever possible. Stanley pushed himself past what his physical limit should have been doing pushups just so he could get the day off. A big part of what concerned Phyllis during the episodes was inner-office politics and party planning. Meredith drank on the job. Jim hit his commission cap under Sabre and just stopped working.

But ignoring shortcomings or limitations of the office cast, you do *not* want to start bringing up jobs and projects that the group has done outside of the government context. Sure, the office might have a number of people who are competent (Ryan, Kelly, Kevin, and Creed are not, there are examples throughout the show about them screwing up or shirking off work), but the parks crew is filled with people who are excellent.

April took on a prominent role at the American Service Foundation after leaving the government where she had done good work taking on a role with the animal shelters. Tom started a successful clothing line and became a high-end restaurateur and author. Andy helped start and develop an international charity based in London. Gerry served as Mayor for decades. Ron has the afformentioned carpentry business. And I haven't even gotten to the heavy hitters.

Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt. Ben was an accounting genius able to land literally any accounting job he wanted. He started a very successful bordgame franchise. And eventually he joined in higher levels of government. He served as a city manager, head of the Sweetums Foundation, and was elected to the **US House of Representatives.**

Leslie is a machine. She has shown to be hyper prepared for anything and everything. She was the driving force behind the government for some time. She received an international award for women in government. She ran for, and won, several positions in the government and took on a position heading up the national parks service. She served as council woman for the city. She served as Govenor of Indiana, and eventually **PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.** **PRESIDENT. OF. THE. UNITED. STATES.**

Ask yourself, which members of the office can call themselves great? Sure they may be good sales people, solid managers of a regional branch of a mid-level paper company, but how many can say that they could be wildly successful at anything from as low a position as Mayor to President of the United States? There is nobody on the office team that comes close to that level of greatness. Half of them can't even do their jobs at a consistent level doing quality control, human resources, or accounting. How many could be president?",0

"BG1 is total hack'n'slash with the thinnest, most threadbare excuse provided for encounters that are haphazardly placed on otherwise featureless maps, requiring the player to go out of their way to explore every inch of fog of war on every map -- despite lacking in-game motivation to do so -- to see if they missed some content that was thrown in there. The game is telling you to go to a town, but you have to choose to explore every inch of green space on every map through which the road to that town passes, or you'll be underleveled and undergeared for later content. And even then, the encounters are almost entirely just one line of dialogue with no meaningful player choice, as the outcome is literally always the same: combat. There is no context or coherence to the combat, and it plays no role in the larger world. Almost all combat in BG1 is of the most generic variety in the history the RT w/ pause genre. You fight hordes of copy-pasted mobs like kobolds, hobgoblins, or gnolls in a chaotic mess wherein the only way to protect your non-tanks is to fight in chokes, which means you mostly just watch the fights unfold (i.e. watch lots of misses) and hope you get the right rolls, holding on to your cool stuff (spells, etc.) until a big set-piece fight. Anyway, it's pretty clear that you love BG2, but I'm suspicious you've played BG1 or any of the Black Isle games at all. Tyranny is thoroughly in the vein of Torment and Fallout. So your preference seems to be for old-school Bioware (specifically BG2) rather than old-school Black Isle, which is fine but might explain why you don't appreciate Tyranny's beauty. It's for a different type of CRPG fan. Don't agree with your point about linearity, either, but it's not worth contesting because we're speaking different languages.",0

"Don't be an idiot, even if we raised the salary of all 4 star generals to $20 Million it's not going to attract any money hungry guy that is smart enough to actually become a 4 star general. It takes 30+ years in one of the the most cutthroat bureaucracies in the worldto get to a point where you get to make that much more money. promotions are slow, you don't get propelled up to the top just for knowing how to talk to people. Even if someone is really money hungry and they do begin working their way up the ranks, they are going to drop out as soon as the get high enough to get a decent job at a company that has defense contracts, and then they are going to attempt to work their way up the ladder there, and try to take over the company or they will just start their own. People that are money hungry aren't going to be satisfied with making the same amount of money every year (and going to jail if they try to make money outside of it) they are going to want to be in the private sector where they can start a company and hopefully go from making a couple million to 100s of millions of dollars.",1

"Don‚Äôt feel bad. A lot of people had this same thought when they first started getting into this sub. There was actually a meme posted about it a week or two ago under the flair ‚Äúhumor.‚Äù Highly entertaining thread.

**TL;DR** There is a TON of information in the r/SCA Wiki. Take the time to read it. If you can‚Äôt find what you‚Äôre looking for in the Wiki, do a search of the sub to see if anyone else has asked. Still can‚Äôt find the info? Then post your question/concern. You don‚Äôt have to buy something expensive to get results. Look for alternatives with the same ingredients.

Most of the things I‚Äôm seeing people complain about on this particular thread have to do with the fact that more seasoned users get frustrated by the constant posts from newer users who haven‚Äôt taken the time to dig through the Wiki and FAQs on the r/SCA homepage. *Damn near everything* you could want to know about skin care and concerns about particular issues is listed in the absolutely VAST amount of information posted in the sidebar. There‚Äôs a beginner‚Äôs guide, acne guide, anti aging, a whole HG products section that they‚Äôre rolling out in phases every week based on the skin care concern. This HG list has been done for at least the past two years, and there are organized links to all of the sections they‚Äôve gone over.

To anyone who says the information isn‚Äôt listed in r/SCA, you haven‚Äôt really been looking for it.

About people recommending nothing but the most expensive products: if someone recommends something, it‚Äôs because it worked for their skin. There are dupes galore available for almost anything you want to buy. If you look at most peoples shelfies, you‚Äôll find at least one or two HG drug store product dupes.

Beyond that, a lot of the basics‚Äîcleanser, treatment product, toner, and moisturizer‚Äîthat people highly recommend are only $7-$20 per product, and you can find just about anything on Amazon. You don‚Äôt have to buy everything from The Ordinary or LaRoche Pose. Buy what you can afford. If someone recommends a product that‚Äôs outside of your budget, then do some research and find an alternative with the same ingredients. Again, people recommend things that work for them, and everyone‚Äôs skin and budget are different. ",1

"I know if your looking for love the best thing to do is sacrafice for others. Jesus did this same thing. And ultimately received a Godly love. Sacrafice will lead to others loving you for your sacrafices. And if you give glory to God every time they thank you for these sacrafices. They see God in you. And you represent that so they love you like they would love God for your sacrafices. It's a amazing feeling and I thank God for it everytime. But ultimate love is recieved through sacrafice. So start sacrificing in the name of Jesus and you will receive a Godly love. Also if your looking for God you will find him working through others who have opened there hearts to God. He is here in earth in the form of the holy spirit. If you ask him to come into your heart this spirit will enter your heart and will alow God to work through you. So when you pray for help from God. A person who has opened there heart to God will be moved by the spirit and come into your life and help you. So anytime a person starts helping you after you pray. This is God working through them, not always but this is a example of how you can see and look for God. He's in other people. ",0

"My main opinion of Yang and Blake meeting each other again is that it would be a great chance for both of them to grow as people and understand the other further. Blake seeing first hand how her constant running away either from wishing to escape her problems or to protect those she cares about hurts those who care about *her* first hand. I believe Sun covered it well IIRC but I just think Yang showing how she had those feelings in some part of her mind for months would just strengthen the impact of it on Blake even more so. Yang finally learning Blake's true motives for running away, while still a bad move due to lack of explanation before hand, would impact Yang strongly as well I think. May just be me but I think Yang saw Blake's running away as trying to escape her problems once again with no regard for her teammates, when in actuality it was quite opposite and it was her desire to protect them that led her to flee. While she would still disagree with the action for the same reasons as Sun, I think it would go a long way to resolving any tension between them, help them grow closer even due to greater understanding of eachother and overall leave a much better impact on the audience. Would seem like a wasted oppurtunity to not tackle it at all at least. Aside from that three paragraph basically unintended fanfiction, I can of course understand the difficulty of maintaining an understanding position in a heated argument. I would plain lying if I said I haven't done as such plenty of times in the past. Glad to know.

No it doesn't contradict it. If you pay attention. I'm saying I want Naruto to train her. Naruto has abilities that counteract the sharingan. Naruto is the only person that can beat Sasuke. If Sarada trains with Naruto and learns to handle Naruto (not even beat him) and is able to understand how her abilities work through fighting someone that can counteract them that will make her Stronger. Sakura has no experience fighting sharingan users. She got Owned by Madara in one hit. Owned by sasuke in one hit and was useful in the Kaguya fight for...one hit. In terms of developing sharingan that can only be sasuke or Kakashi. Backing up experience with science doesn't make sense because Sakura has no experience with sharingan that's even credible. Sakura isn't some sharingan expert. She's a medical ninja. Stop overrating her abilities. Like she's some scientific kabuto/Orochimaru level expert. She knows healing. ,0

"Not too sure about specific things to build a character, but i have some thoughts for helping the team synergy. It's good having a psuedo-healer, but it requires attacking, and for maps with only ranged/distant counter units, also includes damage. To counteract this, it might help to put ardent sacrifice/reciprocal aid on someone, maybe on any units that have vantage.

Might help to use some spd and def seals to help double more enemies and handling high attack high speed/quick ripose units.

The biggest problem for the team is most likely high defense units that can hit back, such as Zelgius or Xander. If this isn't for arena, then the biggest problem of them having vantage shouldn't be an issue, but there would still be trouble in chipping them down and surviving. To handle this, having refined weapons that can def-7 on foes within 2 spaces of target will help tremendously.

As an example of how to handle these threats, i checked a matchup between Saizo and Xander in a damage calculator. If Saizo runs Death Blow, gets atk+4 from Olivia, and Xander is debuffed with def-7, then Saizo can kill a full health Xander (so this build can even handle high defense distant counter unit with vantage). This is only one example, so i don't know about other threats like Zelgius, but this leads me to think Death Blow would be a good choice for Saizo.

Hope all this helps!

So, we've essentially established that not everybody is the same. Some people are black, some people white, some people young, some people old. Another fun fact: these people are not all the same (it's crazy I know). fun fact: Some of these populations have measurable similarities and trends in terms of living conditions, religion, income, etc etc. This is how we know that Hispanic women in aggregate make 57 cents for every dollar a white man makes. This is how we know white people on average live much longer than black people. This is how we know that black people are in aggregate much poorer than white people. This is..... measurable science.

"Screw Odyn, team Helya 2016.

I have heard that pre-alpha, they originally were going to have Sylvanas require more Val'kyr for her people, and Odyn require her to be tested. She assumes right from the get-go that she isn't valorous enough and doesn't bother to attempt his challenge, instead she goes to Helya and they team up.

However, Sylvanas' plans end up ruined, and she has to take the challenge, assuming she will die for her people, but ends up being able to live up to it and she is granted Val'kyr's aid willingly. But it seems that this isn't the direction its going anymore. I suppose that would have fit into what Vol'jin said about her having to step away from her shadowy ways.

There was also plans for Tyrande to GIVE the Legion a pillar of creation in exchange for her husband because Malfurion gets captured and tortured, but it seems now we save him instead and everything is fine. So I guess we'll have to see how the story unfolds.

&gt;Not to mention, there's no way Sylv's in this ""for her people."" Everything she's ever done has been about her and nothing else.

Yes but she's supposed to be making an effort not to be like that anymore, shes warchief.

"You are right I just remembered it being greener than it is. ~~However, that diagram is not to scale.~~ In addition, the armor change was just an artstyle change. It moves better in cutscenes and imo looks a lot better.

Every halo game has a difference in style and if you look at the above photo you would realize that the new armor is just more detailed but does not look that different

This photo shows the halo 2 armor. It has key differences from the halo 3 armor. Likely due to better technology.

You can lobby elected officials to get them to ban speed traps such as this.,0
"You could present a Republican and a Democrat the exact same data set on any given issue, lets say healthcare or jobs, and they would create wildly different narratives using the same data. Neither of them would be lying. It would be spin, extrapolation and prediction, praise or condemnation, but technically not lying.

Fear mongering, slippery slope arguments, strawmen, accusations of communist or dictator, and campaign promises are all things a politician can say at will and never be accused of actually lying. Contrary to popular belief, most ""lies"" told by politicians aren't 100% false, but spin and baseless accusations. These people are professionals. They know how to skirt the truth to varying degrees. It's our responsibility as voters to see through the heaps of bullshit and decide for ourselves instead of instituting some useless law. ",1

"You have to question them, rather than challenge them.

Most people agree that monopolies are bad (which is only conditionally true, but whatever). If they accept that, they should be really doubtful that an entity with a monopoly on force is somehow good. So ask them. ""If monopolies are bad and inefficient, why is this one good and acceptable?""

Usually they'll answer ""its beholden to the voters in a democracy."" So then of course you ask ""if we can't trust people to look after themselves and function well in the market, why can we trust them to be informed and enlightened when voting?""

 What you come to learn is that people have double standards for the government. Its akin to magical thinking. ""A bunch of people operating freely? That's just chaos. Those same people organized into a government? Clearly an efficient, well-oiled machine."" Its THE SAME PEOPLE. What changes?
